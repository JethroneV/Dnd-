--	HOW TO USE:



-- The ObjectTrigger script under the trigger can hold one object to manage.


-- If you want multiple objects for one trigger, just copy the ObjectTrigger script. 

-- (but keep the copy as child under the trigger)


-- Note: The objects have to be visualized


-- The custom properties on the ObjectTrigger script manage how the sound is triggered.

-- (Disappearing takes priority over appearing)


-- The plattform is just for visualization and save to delete.



-- Good luck and have fun :)
